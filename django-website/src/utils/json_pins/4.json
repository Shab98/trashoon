	"description": "The Philippines generates an enormous amount of trash and is the third worst ocean plastic polluter in the world, according to a 2015 study in the journal Science. The trash is piling up on land, clogging coastlines, spilling into the sea, and traveling to remote corners of the globe as the country fails to meet targets for improved waste management that it signed into law 18 years ago.he central government claims it’s done all it can, and that the onus is on local governments and the Philippine people to solve the problem. But environmental advocates disagree, saying the government could do more, including pressuring multinational corporations to change how they package their products.",
